## acl.5
```
     The following entry tag types are defined:

           ACL_USER_OBJ    The ACL_USER_OBJ entry denotes access rights for the file owner.

           ACL_USER        ACL_USER entries denote access rights for users identified by the en‐
                           try's qualifier.

           ACL_GROUP_OBJ   The ACL_GROUP_OBJ entry denotes access rights for the file group.

           ACL_GROUP       ACL_GROUP entries denote access rights for groups identified by the
                           entry's qualifier.

           ACL_MASK        The ACL_MASK entry denotes the maximum access rights that can be
                           granted by entries of type ACL_USER, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, or ACL_GROUP.

           ACL_OTHER       The ACL_OTHER entry denotes access rights for processes that do not
                           match any other entry in the ACL.

```
OBJECT CREATION AND DEFAULT ACLs
     The access ACL of a file object is initialized when the object is created with any of the
     creat(), mkdir(), mknod(), mkfifo(), or open() functions. If a default ACL is associated
     with a directory, the mode parameter to the functions creating file objects and the default
     ACL of the directory are used to determine the ACL of the new object:

     1.   The new object inherits the default ACL of the containing directory as its access ACL.

     2.   The access ACL entries corresponding to the file permission bits are modified so that
          they contain no permissions that are not contained in the permissions specified by the
          mode parameter.

     If no default ACL is associated with a directory, the mode parameter to the functions creat‐
     ing file objects and the file creation mask (see umask(2)) are used to determine the ACL of
     the new object:

     1.   The new object is assigned an access ACL containing entries of tag types ACL_USER_OBJ,
          ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER. The permissions of these entries are set to the permis‐
          sions specified by the file creation mask.

     2.   The access ACL entries corresponding to the file permission bits are modified so that
          they contain no permissions that are not contained in the permissions specified by the
          mode parameter.

ACCESS CHECK ALGORITHM
     A process may request read, write, or execute/search access to a file object protected by an
     ACL. The access check algorithm determines whether access to the object will be granted.

     1.   If the effective user ID of the process matches the user ID of the file object owner,
          then

                if the ACL_USER_OBJ entry contains the requested permissions, access is granted,

                else access is denied.

     2.   else if the effective user ID of the process matches the qualifier of any entry of type
          ACL_USER, then

                if the matching ACL_USER entry and the ACL_MASK entry contain the requested  per‐
                missions, access is granted,

                else access is denied.

     3.   else if the effective group ID or any of the supplementary group IDs of the process
          match the file group or the qualifier of any entry of type ACL_GROUP, then

                if the ACL contains an ACL_MASK entry, then

                      if the ACL_MASK entry and any of the matching  ACL_GROUP_OBJ  or  ACL_GROUP
                      entries contain the requested permissions, access is granted,

                      else access is denied.

                else (note that there can be no ACL_GROUP entries without an ACL_MASK entry)

                      if  the  ACL_GROUP_OBJ  entry contains the requested permissions, access is
                      granted,

                      else access is denied.

     4.   else if the ACL_OTHER entry contains the requested permissions, access is granted.

     5.   else access is denied.

Thin Usage
       The primary method for using lvm thin provisioning:

   1. create ThinDataLV
       Create an LV that will hold thin pool data.

       lvcreate -n ThinDataLV -L LargeSize VG

       Example
       # lvcreate -n pool0 -L 10G vg

   2. create ThinMetaLV
       Create an LV that will hold thin pool metadata.

       lvcreate -n ThinMetaLV -L SmallSize VG

       Example
       # lvcreate -n pool0meta -L 1G vg

       # lvs
         LV        VG Attr       LSize
         pool0     vg -wi-a----- 10.00g
         pool0meta vg -wi-a----- 1.00g

   3. create ThinPoolLV
       Combine the data and metadata LVs into a thin pool LV.
       ThinDataLV is renamed to hidden ThinPoolLV_tdata.
       ThinMetaLV is renamed to hidden ThinPoolLV_tmeta.
       The new ThinPoolLV takes the previous name of ThinDataLV.

       lvconvert --type thin-pool --poolmetadata VG/ThinMetaLV VG/ThinDataLV

       Example
       # lvconvert --type thin-pool --poolmetadata vg/pool0meta vg/pool0

       # lvs vg/pool0
         LV    VG Attr       LSize  Pool Origin Data% Meta%
         pool0 vg twi-a-tz-- 10.00g      0.00   0.00

       # lvs -a
         LV            VG Attr       LSize
         pool0         vg twi-a-tz-- 10.00g
         [pool0_tdata] vg Twi-ao---- 10.00g
         [pool0_tmeta] vg ewi-ao---- 1.00g

   4. create ThinLV
       Create a new thin LV from the thin pool LV.
       The thin LV is created with a virtual size.
       Multiple new thin LVs may be created in the thin pool.
       Thin LV names must be unique in the VG.
       The '--type thin' option is inferred from the virtual size option.
       The --thinpool argument specifies which thin pool will
       contain the ThinLV.

       lvcreate -n ThinLV -V VirtualSize --thinpool ThinPoolLV VG

       Example
       Create a thin LV in a thin pool:
       # lvcreate -n thin1 -V 1T --thinpool pool0 vg

       Create another thin LV in the same thin pool:
       # lvcreate -n thin2 -V 1T --thinpool pool0 vg

       # lvs vg/thin1 vg/thin2
         LV    VG Attr       LSize Pool  Origin Data%
         thin1 vg Vwi-a-tz-- 1.00t pool0        0.00
         thin2 vg Vwi-a-tz-- 1.00t pool0        0.00
```
